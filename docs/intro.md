# Unified Health Ecosystem

## Aim

We aim to create open-source digital assets to help hospitals and healthcare facilities, and patients onboard the _Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission_ launched by the Government of India.

The primary product of our project shall be a platform that helps health facilities register themselves and their doctors and caretakers onto the ABDM. Patients too can use the platform to register themselves.

## Project Scope

The product aims to help make a healthcare facility M1 compliant by providing features for creation of ABHI ID (health ID) for patients. Doctors can also be onboarded onto the ADBM using the product. For a healthcare facility to become M1 compliant, it should be able to create ABHI IDs for patients and be able to onboard their doctors to ABDM.

Our assets provide an easy to use layer above the Government of India's ABDM infrastructure with the primary purpose of increasing the number of patients and healthcare facilities registered with the ABDM.
